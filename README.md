# Residential-PV-vs-Corporative-
A scenario Analysis 
####
In this work  the economic feasibility of ARPV(Aggergated Residential PV)  with respect 
to IPVs (Individual Solar PV)  for domestic electricity consumers in Delhi was 
investigated. Semi-structured interviews were conducted 
with 5 domestic consumers of Delhi to obtain detailed hourly 
load profiles for every month. Based on annual energy 
demand and irradiance in Delhi, six PV systems were 
designed. There were five IPVs for consumers. The sixth PV 
system was ARPV which served the energy demand of all 
five consumers. Economic analysis was based on the hourly 
load profile of consumers, hourly generated PV power, tariff 
regulations of Delhi, and applicable investment costs present 
in the financial year 2020-21. The economic analysis was in 
terms of annual savings
